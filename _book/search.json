    "text": "1.1 Origin of the word ‚ÄúStatistics‚Äù\nTerm statistics was derived from the Neo-Latin word statisticum collegium meaning ‚Äúcouncil of state‚Äù and the Italian word statista meaning ‚Äústatesman‚Äù or ‚Äúpolitician‚Äù.\nA German word Statistik, got the meaning ‚Äúcollection and classification of data‚Äù generally in the early 19th century. This word was first introduced by Gottfried Achenwall (1749). Statistik was originally designated as a term for analysis of data about the state (data used by government or other administrative bodies). The term Statistik was introduced into English in 1791 by Sir John Sinclair when he published the first of 21 volumes titled ‚ÄúStatistical Account of Scotland‚Äù (Ball 2004). The first book to have ‚ÄòStatistics‚Äô in its title was ‚ÄúContributions to Vital Statistics‚Äù (1845) by Francis GP Neison, actuary1 to the Medical Invalid and General Life Office.\nStatistical Account of Scotland by Sir John Sinclair (1791)",

    "text": "1.2 Statistics and Mathematics\nMathematics follows a rigid theorem and proof. Mathematical theories involve well-defined and proven facts which has the minimal scope of change. However, Statistics is a discipline where real-life data is handled. This factor makes this field of study more abstract, where individuals have to develop newer solutions to problems that was new and not observed before. Statistics is an applied science; in mathematics the goal is to prove theorems. In statistics, the main goal is to develop good methods for understanding data and making decisions. Statisticians often use mathematical theorems to justify their methods, but theorems are not the main focus. Statistics is now considered as an independent field which uses mathematics to solve real life problems.",

    "text": "1.8 Types of variables\n\n1.8.1 Quantitative variables\nA quantitative variable is one that can take numerical values. The variables like number of fruits in a branch, number of plots in a field, number of schools in a country, plant height, yield, panicle length, temperature, etc. are examples of quantitative variables. Quantitative variables may be characterized further as to whether they are discrete or continuous\n\nDiscrete variables\nThe variables like number of fruits in a branch, number of plots in a field, number of schools in a country, etc. can be counted. These are examples of discrete variables. Variables that can only take on a finite number of values are called ‚Äúdiscrete variables.‚Äù Any variable phrased as ‚Äúthe number of ‚Ä¶‚Äù, is discrete, because it is possible to list its possible values {0,1, ‚Ä¶}. Any variable with a finite number of possible values is discrete. The following example illustrates the point. The number of daily admissions to a hospital is a discrete variable since it can be represented by a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 or 3. The number of daily admissions on a given day cannot be a number such as 1.8, 3.96 or 5.33.\n\n\nContinuous variables\nThe variables like plant height, yield, panicle length, temperature, etc. can be measured. These are examples of continuous variables. A continuous variable does not possess the gaps or interruptions characteristic of a discrete variable. A continuous variable can assume any value within a specific relevant interval of values assumed by the variable. Notice that age is continuous since an individual does not age in discrete jumps. Panicle length can be measured as 5.5, 5.8 cm etc so, it is a continuous variable.\n\n\n\n1.8.2 Categorical variables\nA variable is called categorical when the measurement scale is a set of categories. For example, marital status, with categories (single,married, widowed), is categorical. Whether employed (yes, no), religious affiliation (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, others, none), colours etc. Categorical variables are often called qualitative. It can be seen that categorical variables can neither be measured nor counted.",

    "section": "1.9 Measurement scales",
    "text": "1.9 Measurement scales\nVariables can further be classified according to the following four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.\n\n1.9.1 Nominal scale\nThis scale of measure applies to qualitative variables only. On the nominal scale, no order is required. For example,gender is nominal, blood group is nominal, and marital status is also nominal. We cannot perform arithmetic operations on data measured on the nominal scale.\n\n\n1.9.2 Ordinal scale\nThis scale also applies to qualitative data. On the ordinal scale, order is necessary. This means that one category is lower than the next one or vice versa. For example, Grades are ordinal, as excellent is higher than very good, which in turn is higher than good, and so on. It should be noted that, in the ordinal scale, differences between category values have no meaning.\n\n\n1.9.3 Interval scale\nThis scale of measurement applies to quantitative data only. In this scale, the zero point does not indicate a total absence of the quantity being measured. An example of such a scale is temperature on the Celsius or Fahrenheit scale. Suppose the minimum temperatures of 3 cities, A, B and C, on a particular day were 00C, 200C and 100C, respectively. It is clear that we can find the differences between these temperatures. For example, city B is 200C hotter than city A. However, we cannot say that city A has no temperature. Moreover, we cannot say that city B is twice as hot as city C, just because city B is 200C and city C is 100C. The reason is that, in the interval scale, the ratio between two numbers is not meaningful.\n\n\n1.9.4 Ratio scale\nThis scale of measurement also applies to quantitative data only and has all the properties of the interval scale. In addition to these properties, the ratio scale has a meaningful zero starting point and a meaningful ratio between 2 numbers. An example of variables measured on the ratio scale, is weight. A weighing scale that reads 0 kg gives an indication that there is absolutely no weight on it. So the zero starting point is meaningful. If Ram weighs 60 kg and Laxman weighs 30 kg, then Ram weighs twice as Laxman. Another example of a variable measured on the ratio scale is temperature measured on the Kelvin scale. This has a true zero point.\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification of variables",

    "text": "1.16 Terms used in grouped frequency tables.\n\n1.16.1 Class limits\nThe intervals into which the observations are put are called class intervals. The end points of the class intervals are called class limits. For example, the class interval 100 ‚Äì 109, has lower class limit 100 and upper class limit 109.\n\n\n1.16.2 Class boundaries\nThe raw data in the above example were recorded to the nearest centimeters. Thus, a plant height of 109.5cm would have been recorded as 110cm, a plant height of 119.4 cm would have been recorded as 119cm, while a plant height of 119.5 cm would have been recorded as 120 cm. It can therefore be seen that, the class interval 110 ‚Äì 119, consists of measurements greater than or equal to 109.5 cm and less than 119.5 cm. The numbers 109.5 and 119.5 are called the lower and upper boundaries of the class interval 110 ‚Äì 120. The class boundaries of the other class intervals are given below:\n\n\n\n\n\nClass boundary and class limits\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nNotice that the lower class boundary of the ith class interval is the mean of the lower class limit of the class interval and the upper class limit of the (i-1)th class interval (i = 2, 3, 4, ‚Ä¶). For example, in the table above the lower class boundaries of the second and the fourth class intervals are (110 + 119) /2 = 114.5 and (130 + 139)/2 = 134.5 respectively.\nIt can also be seen that the upper class boundary of the ith class interval is the mean of the upper class limit of the class interval and the lower class limit of the (i+1)th class interval (i = 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶). Thus, in the above table the upper class boundary of the fourth class interval is (130 + 139)/2 = 134.5.\n\n\n1.16.3 Class mark\nThe mid-point of a class interval is called the class mark or class mid-point of the class interval. It is the average of the upper and lower class limits of the class interval. It is also the average of the upper and lower class boundaries of the class interval. For example, in the table, the class mark of the third class interval was found as follows: class mark =(120+129)/2 = (119.5 + 129.5)/2= 124.5.\n\n\n1.16.4 Class width\nThe difference between the upper and lower class boundaries of a class interval is called the class width of the class interval. Class widths of class intervals can also be found by subtracting two consecutive lower class limits, or by subtracting two consecutive upper class limits.\nNote:\nThe width of the ith class interval is the numerical difference between the upper class limits of the ith and the ( i-1)th class intervals (i = 2, 3, ‚Ä¶). It is also the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the ith and the (i+1)th class intervals (i = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶).\nIn grouped frequency table above the width of the second class interval is |110-119| = 9. This is the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the second and the third class intervals. The width of the third class interval is |120-129|= 9. This is the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the third and the fourth class intervals.",

Set up the individual class limits\nStep 4. Tally the items into the classes\nStep 5. Count the number of items in each class\nConsider the example\nAn agricultural student measured the lengths of leaves on an oak tree (to the nearest cm). Measurements on 38 leaves are as follows\n9,16,13,7,8,4,18,10,17,18,9,12,5,9,9,16,1,8,17,1,10,5,9,11,15,6,14,9,1,12,5,16,4,16,8,15,14,17\nStep 1. Decide how many classes you wish to use.\nH.A. Sturges provides a formula for determining the approximation number of classes. \\[\\mathbf{k = 1 + 3.322}\\mathbf{\\log}\\mathbf{N}\\] Number of classes should be greater than calculated k\nIn our example N=38, so k= (1+3.322)√ólog(38) = (1+3.322)√ó1.5797 = 6.24 = approx 7\nSo the approximated number of classes should be not less than 6.24 i.e.\\(\\ k^{'}\\) =7\nStep 2. Determine the class width\nGenerally, the class width should be the same size for all classes. C= | max ‚àí min|/ k. Class width \\(C^{'}\\)should be greater than calculated C. For this example, C = | 18‚àí 1|/6.24 = 2.72, so approximately class width \\(C^{'} =\\) 3 (Note that k used here is the calculated value using Sturges formula not the approximated).\nStep 3. To set up the individual class limits, we need to find the lower limit only\n\\[L = min - \\frac{C^{'} \\times k^{'} - (max - min)}{2}\\]\nwhere C and k here are final approximated class width and number of classes respectively in our example \\(L = 1 - \\frac{(3 \\times 7) - (18 - 1)}{2}\\)=1-2=-1; since there is no negative values in data = 0.\n\n\n\nClass\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n0-3\n3\n\n\n3-6\n5\n\n\n6-9\n5\n\n\n9-12\n9\n\n\n12-15\n5\n\n\n15-18\n9\n\n\n18-21\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the student only measured in whole numbers, the data is continuous, so ‚Äú4 cm‚Äù means the actual value could have been anywhere from 3.5 cm to 4.5 cm.",

For example, in the above table, it can be seen that 3 leaves have length less than 3.5 cm and 9 leaves (i.e.¬†3 + 6) have length less than 6.5 cm. These frequencies are called cumulative frequencies. A table of such cumulative frequencies is called a cumulative frequency table or cumulative frequency distribution.\nCumulative frequency is defined as a running total of frequencies. Cumulative frequency can also defined as the sum of all previous frequencies up to the current point. Notice that the last cumulative frequency is equal to the sum of all the frequencies. Two types of cumulative frequencies are Less than cumulative frequency and Greater than cumulative frequency. Less than cumulative frequency (LCF) is the number of values less than a specified value. Greater than cumulative frequency (GCF) is the number of observations greater than a specified value.\nThe specified value for LCF in the case of grouped frequency distribution will be upper limits and for GCF will be the lower limits of the classes.

Statistics, while being an essential tool in agricultural sciences, is often presented in ways that make it seem more complicated than it actually is. Textbooks in this field tend to delve into intricate details that go far beyond what most agricultural students require, leaving them overwhelmed and disconnected from the subject‚Äôs practical relevance.\nThis book is my humble attempt to change that. It has been written with undergraduate students in mind, focusing on the basics of statistics and their direct applications in agricultural research. Each chapter is designed to simplify complex concepts, making them clear, relatable, and easy to understand. While the primary audience is undergraduate students, this book can also serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to brush up on the fundamentals of statistics.\nThe journey of writing this book has been greatly enriched by the feedback and insights of the students at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. For two years, an earlier version of this book was made available on MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes), our college‚Äôs online platform. The students, with their thoughtful suggestions and sharp observations, have helped refine the content and shape it into what it is today. Their enthusiasm and curiosity have been a constant source of inspiration throughout this process.\nI would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my co-authors, Dr.¬†Manju Mary Paul, Dr.¬†Adarsh V. S., and Mohammed Hisham, whose expertise, commitment, and contributions have been invaluable in bringing this book to life. Their collaboration and dedication have greatly enhanced the quality and depth of this work.\nI hope this textbook becomes a guiding light for students and researchers alike, helping them build a solid foundation in statistics while inspiring confidence in their ability to use these tools effectively. If this book makes statistics less intimidating and more approachable for even one reader, I will consider my efforts worthwhile.\nWith deep gratitude to my students, colleagues, and everyone who supported this work, I present this book as a tool to empower the next generation of agricultural scientists and researchers.\nDr.¬†Pratheesh P.

A German word Statistik, got the meaning ‚Äúcollection and classification of data‚Äù generally in the early 19th century. This word was first introduced by Gottfried Achenwall (1749). Statistik was originally designated as a term for analysis of data about the state (data used by government or other administrative bodies). The term Statistik was introduced into English in 1791 by Sir John Sinclair when he published the first of 21 volumes titled ‚ÄúStatistical Account of Scotland‚Äù (Ball 2004). The first book to have ‚ÄòStatistics‚Äô in its title was ‚ÄúContributions to Vital Statistics‚Äù (1845) by Francis GP Neison, actuary1 to the Medical Invalid and General Life Office.",

However, Statistics is a discipline where real-life data is handled. This factor makes this field of study more abstract, where individuals have to develop newer solutions to problems that was new and not observed before. Statistics is an applied science; in mathematics the goal is to prove theorems. In statistics, the main goal is to develop good methods for understanding data and making decisions. Statisticians often use mathematical theorems to justify their methods, but theorems are not the main focus.

It supports decision-making by presenting facts in an organized manner, aids in the formulation of effective policies, facilitates comparisons, and assists in making forecasts. By applying appropriate statistical methods, researchers can draw valid conclusions from experiments.\nApplications of Statistics: Statistics has become an integral part of almost every field of human activity. It is indispensable in areas such as administration, business, economics, research, banking, insurance, and more. Its ability to quantify and analyze data makes it an essential tool across industries.\nCommon Limitations of Statistics: - Statistical methods are applicable only when there is variability in the data being studied. - Statistics focuses on the analysis of groups or aggregates, rather than individual data points. - The results derived from statistical analysis are often approximate and subject to uncertainty. - Statistics is sometimes misapplied or misinterpreted, leading to erroneous conclusions.\nAs a statistician, I believe that the power of statistics knows no bounds. It is a tool that, when applied correctly, can unlock insights from any dataset. While the limitations listed above are commonly found in textbooks and curricula across SAUs (State Agricultural Universities), I believe these are more about guiding students on the appropriate use of statistics rather than presenting true constraints. With the right methodology and approach, statistics can be applied in any situation to derive valuable insights and support sound decision-making.",

The variables like number of fruits in a branch, number of plots in a field, number of schools in a country, plant height, yield, panicle length, temperature, etc. are examples of quantitative variables. Quantitative variables may be characterized further as to whether they are discrete or continuous\n\nDiscrete variables\nThe variables like number of fruits in a branch, number of plots in a field, number of schools in a country, etc. can be counted. These are examples of discrete variables. Variables that can only take on a finite number of values are called ‚Äúdiscrete variables.‚Äù Any variable phrased as ‚Äúthe number of ‚Ä¶‚Äù, is discrete, because it is possible to list its possible values {0,1, ‚Ä¶}. Any variable with a finite number of possible values is discrete. The following example illustrates the point. The number of daily admissions to a hospital is a discrete variable since it can be represented by a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 or 3. The number of daily admissions on a given day cannot be a number such as 1.8, 3.96 or 5.33.\n\n\nContinuous variables\nThe variables like plant height, yield, panicle length, temperature, etc. can be measured. These are examples of continuous variables. A continuous variable does not possess the gaps or interruptions characteristic of a discrete variable. A continuous variable can assume any value within a specific relevant interval of values assumed by the variable. Notice that age is continuous since an individual does not age in discrete jumps. Panicle length can be measured as 5.5, 5.8 cm etc so, it is a continuous variable.\n\n\n\n1.8.2 Categorical variables\nA variable is called categorical when the measurement scale is a set of categories. For example, marital status, with categories (single,married, widowed), is categorical. Whether employed (yes, no), religious affiliation (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, others, none), colours etc. Categorical variables are often called qualitative. It can be seen that categorical variables can neither be measured nor counted.",

    "text": "1.9 Measurement scales\nVariables can further be classified according to the following four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.\n\n1.9.1 Nominal scale\nThis scale of measure applies to qualitative variables only. On the nominal scale, no order is required. For example,gender is nominal, blood group is nominal, and marital status is also nominal. We cannot perform arithmetic operations on data measured on the nominal scale.\n\n\n1.9.2 Ordinal scale\nThis scale also applies to qualitative data. On the ordinal scale, order is necessary. This means that one category is lower than the next one or vice versa. For example, Grades are ordinal, as excellent is higher than very good, which in turn is higher than good, and so on. It should be noted that, in the ordinal scale, differences between category values have no meaning.\n\n\n1.9.3 Interval scale\nThis scale of measurement applies to quantitative data only. In this scale, the zero point does not indicate a total absence of the quantity being measured. An example of such a scale is temperature on the Celsius or Fahrenheit scale. Suppose the minimum temperatures of 3 cities, A, B and C, on a particular day were 00C, 200C and 100C, respectively. It is clear that we can find the differences between these temperatures. For example, city B is 200C hotter than city A. However, we cannot say that city A has no temperature. Moreover, we cannot say that city B is twice as hot as city C, just because city B is 200C and city C is 100C. The reason is that, in the interval scale, the ratio between two numbers is not meaningful.\n\n\n1.9.4 Ratio scale\nThis scale of measurement also applies to quantitative data only and has all the properties of the interval scale. In addition to these properties, the ratio scale has a meaningful zero starting point and a meaningful ratio between 2 numbers. An example of variables measured on the ratio scale, is weight. A weighing scale that reads 0 kg gives an indication that there is absolutely no weight on it. So the zero starting point is meaningful. If Ram weighs 60 kg and Laxman weighs 30 kg, then Ram weighs twice as Laxman. Another example of a variable measured on the ratio scale is temperature measured on the Kelvin scale. This has a true zero point.",

For instance, it can be seen that 14 of the 20 paddy varieties have plant height between 110 cm and 139 cm (both inclusive). This information cannot easily be obtained from the raw data.\nIt should be noted that, even though above table is concise, some information is lost. For example, the grouped frequency distribution does not give us the exact plant height of the paddy varieties. Thus the individual plant height of the paddy varieties are lost in our effort to obtain an overall picture.",

The end points of the class intervals are called class limits. For example, the class interval 100 ‚Äì 109, has lower class limit 100 and upper class limit 109.\n\n\n1.16.2 Class boundaries\nThe raw data in the above example were recorded to the nearest centimeters. Thus, a plant height of 109.5cm would have been recorded as 110cm, a plant height of 119.4 cm would have been recorded as 119cm, while a plant height of 119.5 cm would have been recorded as 120 cm. It can therefore be seen that, the class interval 110 ‚Äì 119, consists of measurements greater than or equal to 109.5 cm and less than 119.5 cm. The numbers 109.5 and 119.5 are called the lower and upper boundaries of the class interval 110 ‚Äì 120. The class boundaries of the other class intervals are given below:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\nNotice that the lower class boundary of the ith class interval is the mean of the lower class limit of the class interval and the upper class limit of the (i-1)th class interval (i = 2, 3, 4, ‚Ä¶). For example, in the table above the lower class boundaries of the second and the fourth class intervals are (110 + 119) /2 = 114.5 and (130 + 139)/2 = 134.5 respectively.\nIt can also be seen that the upper class boundary of the ith class interval is the mean of the upper class limit of the class interval and the lower class limit of the (i+1)th class interval (i = 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶). Thus, in the above table the upper class boundary of the fourth class interval is (130 + 139)/2 = 134.5.\n\n\n1.16.3 Class mark\nThe mid-point of a class interval is called the class mark or class mid-point of the class interval. It is the average of the upper and lower class limits of the class interval. It is also the average of the upper and lower class boundaries of the class interval. For example, in the table, the class mark of the third class interval was found as follows: class mark =(120+129)/2 = (119.5 + 129.5)/2= 124.5.\n\n\n1.16.4 Class width\nThe difference between the upper and lower class boundaries of a class interval is called the class width of the class interval. Class widths of class intervals can also be found by subtracting two consecutive lower class limits, or by subtracting two consecutive upper class limits.\nNote:\nThe width of the ith class interval is the numerical difference between the upper class limits of the ith and the ( i-1)th class intervals (i = 2, 3, ‚Ä¶). It is also the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the ith and the (i+1)th class intervals (i = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶).\nIn grouped frequency table above the width of the second class interval is |110-119| = 9. This is the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the second and the third class intervals. The width of the third class interval is |120-129|= 9. This is the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the third and the fourth class intervals.",

Set up the individual class limits\nStep 4. Tally the items into the classes\nStep 5. Count the number of items in each class\nConsider the example\nAn agricultural student measured the lengths of leaves on an oak tree (to the nearest cm). Measurements on 38 leaves are as follows\n9,16,13,7,8,4,18,10,17,18,9,12,5,9,9,16,1,8,17,1,10,5,9,11,15,6,14,9,1,12,5,16,4,16,8,15,14,17\nStep 1. Decide how many classes you wish to use.\nH.A. Sturges provides a formula for determining the approximation number of classes. \\[\\mathbf{k = 1 + 3.322}\\mathbf{\\log}\\mathbf{N}\\] Number of classes should be greater than calculated k\nIn our example N=38, so k= (1+3.322)√ólog(38) = (1+3.322)√ó1.5797 = 6.24 = approx 7\nSo the approximated number of classes should be not less than 6.24 i.e.\\(\\ k^{'}\\) =7\nStep 2. Determine the class width\nGenerally, the class width should be the same size for all classes. C= | max ‚àí min|/ k. Class width \\(C^{'}\\)should be greater than calculated C. For this example, C = | 18‚àí 1|/6.24 = 2.72, so approximately class width \\(C^{'} =\\) 3 (Note that k used here is the calculated value using Sturges formula not the approximated).\nStep 3. To set up the individual class limits, we need to find the lower limit only\n\\[L = min - \\frac{C^{'} \\times k^{'} - (max - min)}{2}\\]\nwhere C and k here are final approximated class width and number of classes respectively in our example \\(L = 1 - \\frac{(3 \\times 7) - (18 - 1)}{2}\\)=1-2=-1; since there is no negative values in data = 0.\n\n\n\nClass\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n0-3\n3\n\n\n3-6\n5\n\n\n6-9\n5\n\n\n9-12\n9\n\n\n12-15\n5\n\n\n15-18\n9\n\n\n18-21\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the student only measured in whole numbers, the data is continuous, so ‚Äú4 cm‚Äù means the actual value could have been anywhere from 3.5 cm to 4.5 cm.",

    "text": "1.18 Cumulative frequency\nIn many situations, we are not interested in the number of observations in a given class interval, but in the number of observations which are less than (or greater than) a specified value. For example, in the above table, it can be seen that 3 leaves have length less than 3.5 cm and 9 leaves (i.e.¬†3 + 6) have length less than 6.5 cm. These frequencies are called cumulative frequencies. A table of such cumulative frequencies is called a cumulative frequency table or cumulative frequency distribution.\nCumulative frequency is defined as a running total of frequencies. Cumulative frequency can also defined as the sum of all previous frequencies up to the current point. Notice that the last cumulative frequency is equal to the sum of all the frequencies. Two types of cumulative frequencies are Less than cumulative frequency and Greater than cumulative frequency. Less than cumulative frequency (LCF) is the number of values less than a specified value. Greater than cumulative frequency (GCF) is the number of observations greater than a specified value.\nThe specified value for LCF in the case of grouped frequency distribution will be upper limits and for GCF will be the lower limits of the classes. LCF‚Äôs are obtained by adding frequencies in the successive classes and GCF are obtained by subtracting the successive class frequencies from the total frequency.",
