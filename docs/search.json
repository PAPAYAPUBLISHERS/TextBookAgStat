    "text": "For a long time, I have dreamed of writing a book that truly serves the needs of undergraduate students in agriculture—a book that demystifies statistics and makes it accessible and practical for their studies and research. Statistics, while being an essential tool in agricultural sciences, is often presented in ways that make it seem more complicated than it actually is. Textbooks in this field tend to delve into intricate details that go far beyond what most agricultural students require, leaving them overwhelmed and disconnected from the subject’s practical relevance.\nThis book is my humble attempt to change that. It has been written with undergraduate students in mind, focusing on the basics of statistics and their direct applications in agricultural research. Each chapter is designed to simplify complex concepts, making them clear, relatable, and easy to understand. While the primary audience is undergraduate students, this book can also serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to brush up on the fundamentals of statistics.\nThe journey of writing this book has been greatly enriched by the feedback and insights of the students at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. For two years, an earlier version of this book was made available on MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes), our college’s online platform. The students, with their thoughtful suggestions and sharp observations, have helped refine the content and shape it into what it is today. Their enthusiasm and curiosity have been a constant source of inspiration throughout this process.\nI would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my co-authors, Dr. Manju Mary Paul, Dr. Adarsh V. S., and Mohammed Hisham, whose expertise, commitment, and contributions have been invaluable in bringing this book to life. Their collaboration and dedication have greatly enhanced the quality and depth of this work.\nI hope this textbook becomes a guiding light for students and researchers alike, helping them build a solid foundation in statistics while inspiring confidence in their ability to use these tools effectively. If this book makes statistics less intimidating and more approachable for even one reader, I will consider my efforts worthwhile.\nWith deep gratitude to my students, colleagues, and everyone who supported this work, I present this book as a tool to empower the next generation of agricultural scientists and researchers.\nDr. Pratheesh P. Gopinath\nDepartment of Agricultural Statistics\nCollege of Agriculture, Vellayani\n2 December 2024",

    "text": "1.1 The word “Statistics”\nTerm statistics was derived from the Neo-Latin word statisticum collegium meaning “council of state” and the Italian word statista meaning “statesman” or “politician”. A German word Statistik, got the meaning “collection and classification of data” generally in the early 19th century. This word was first introduced by Gottfried Achenwall (1749). Statistik was originally designated as a term for analysis of data about the state (data used by government or other administrative bodies). The term Statistik was introduced into English in 1791 by Sir John Sinclair when he published the first of 21 volumes titled “Statistical Account of Scotland” (Ball 2004). The first book to have ‘Statistics’ in its title was “Contributions to Vital Statistics” (1845) by Francis GP Neison, actuary1 to the Medical Invalid and General Life Office.",

    "text": "1.2 Statistics and Mathematics\nMathematics is like a well-organized library where everything follows strict rules and paths—once a theorem is proven, it stays true with little room for change. But statistics is more like a vast, open field where you have to adapt to new situations. Why? Because it deals with real-world data, which is often messy, unpredictable, and full of noise (also known as the error term). In statistics, you’re not just proving theorems—you’re finding ways to understand data, account for uncertainties, and make informed decisions based on that data.\nIn biological phenomena, where we often study complex systems like plants, animals, or ecosystems, exact results are not always achievable. There are many factors influencing the outcomes that we cannot always measure or control. This is where the error term comes in. It represents the variation between observed and predicted values in a model. Even though we can try to predict patterns in biology, the results will always have some level of uncertainty or error due to the complexity and variability of living systems.\nStatisticians acknowledge this uncertainty, using mathematical models to represent biological phenomena while accounting for these errors. Rather than focusing on achieving perfect results, the goal is to develop models that provide useful insights despite the inherent unpredictability. Statisticians use these models to understand and explain biological phenomena, accepting that exact predictions are often out of reach, but valuable insights can still be drawn from the data.",

    "text": "1.4 Data\nData can be defined as individual pieces of factual information that are recorded and used to draw meaningful insights through the science of statistics. Think of data as the building blocks that form the foundation for understanding the world around us. It’s the raw material from which we extract patterns, trends, and conclusions that help us make better decisions.\nIn today’s fast-paced world, data is more important than ever. From predicting weather patterns to optimizing business strategies, data is at the heart of nearly every advancement. Without data, we’re left with guesswork—making it impossible to understand complex systems or make informed decisions.\nHere are some examples of data in action:\n\nNumber of farmers in a village: Understanding this helps policymakers make decisions about agricultural development and rural economics.\nRainfall over a period of time: This data is crucial for predicting crop yields, planning irrigation, and managing water resources.\nArea under paddy crop in a state: This informs agricultural policies, resource allocation, and even global food supply chains.\n\nAs you can see, data isn’t just a collection of numbers; it’s the key to solving real-world problems and shaping the future. In the hands of skilled statisticians, data has the power to unlock insights that can improve lives, drive innovation, and guide decisions at every level.",

    "text": "1.5 Use and Limitations of Statistics\nFunctions of Statistics: Statistics plays a crucial role in simplifying complex data, transforming it into clear and meaningful information. It supports decision-making by presenting facts in an organized manner, aids in the formulation of effective policies, facilitates comparisons, and assists in making forecasts. By applying appropriate statistical methods, researchers can draw valid conclusions from experiments.\nApplications of Statistics: Statistics has become an integral part of almost every field of human activity. It is indispensable in areas such as administration, business, economics, research, banking, insurance, and more. Its ability to quantify and analyze data makes it an essential tool across industries.\nCommon Limitations of Statistics: - Statistical methods are applicable only when there is variability in the data being studied. - Statistics focuses on the analysis of groups or aggregates, rather than individual data points. - The results derived from statistical analysis are often approximate and subject to uncertainty. - Statistics is sometimes misapplied or misinterpreted, leading to erroneous conclusions.\nAs a statistician, I believe that the power of statistics knows no bounds. It is a tool that, when applied correctly, can unlock insights from any dataset. While the limitations listed above are commonly found in textbooks and curricula across SAUs (State Agricultural Universities), I believe these are more about guiding students on the appropriate use of statistics rather than presenting true constraints. With the right methodology and approach, statistics can be applied in any situation to derive valuable insights and support sound decision-making.",

    "text": "1.6 Population and Sample\nConsider the following example. Suppose we wish to study the height of all students in a college. It will take us a long time to measure the height of all students of the college and so we may select 20 of the students and measure their height (in cm). Suppose we obtain the measurements like this\n149 156 148 161 159 143 158 152 164 171 157 152 163 158 151 147 157 146 153 159\nIn this study, we are interested in the height of all students in the college. The set of height of all students in the college is called the population of this study. The set of 20 height, H = {149, 156,148, …, 153, 159}, is a sample from this population.\nPopulation\nIn statistics, a population refers to the entire collection of elements, individuals, or objects that possess a particular characteristic and are the subject of a statistical study. It encompasses all possible observations or measurements that could be included in the analysis. For example, a population could be all the students in a university, all the trees in a forest, or all the farms in a region. The population provides the complete set of data from which conclusions can be drawn.\nSample\nA sample is a subset of a population selected for the purpose of conducting a statistical analysis. It represents a smaller group drawn from the population, ideally chosen to reflect its characteristics. Samples are used to estimate population parameters when it is impractical or impossible to collect data from the entire population. The key to a good sample is that it should be representative of the population to allow valid inferences to be made.\nPopulation Parameter A population parameter is a numerical characteristic or value that describes an aspect of an entire population. It is a fixed (cons), often unknown value that represents the true measurement of a specific attribute for every member of the population. Common population parameters include the population mean, population variance, and population proportion. Since it is usually impractical or impossible to measure the entire population, parameters are often estimated using sample data.",

In other words, variables are subject to change. Examples of variables include:\n\nThe number of fruits on a branch, the number of plots in a field, or the number of schools in a country.\nPlant height, crop yield, panicle length, or temperature.\n\nVariables can be classified into two broad categories: quantitative variables, which are measured on a numerical scale (such as height or yield), and qualitative (or categorical) variables, which describe categories or characteristics (such as plant species or color).\nConstants\nA constant refers to a value that does not change under any circumstances. Unlike variables, constants retain the same value throughout the study. Examples of constants include mathematical values such as pi (𝝅), which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter (𝝅 = 3.14159…), and e, the base of the natural logarithms (e = 2.71828).",

    "text": "1.8 Types of Variables\nQuantitative Variables\nA quantitative variable is one that can be expressed in numerical terms and takes values that are measurable. Examples of quantitative variables include the number of fruits on a branch, the number of plots in a field, the number of schools in a country, plant height, crop yield, panicle length, and temperature. Quantitative variables can be further classified into two categories: discrete and continuous.\nDiscrete Variables\nDiscrete variables are variables that can only take a finite or countable number of distinct values. They are often whole numbers and can be counted. For instance, the number of fruits on a branch, the number of plots in a field, or the number of schools in a country are all discrete variables.\nSince discrete variables represent countable quantities, they can only take specific, separate values, such as 0, 1, 2, etc. For example, the number of daily hospital admissions is a discrete variable because it can only take whole number values like 0, 1, or 2, but not fractional values like 1.8 or 3.96.\nContinuous Variables\nContinuous variables, on the other hand, are variables that can take any value within a given range or interval and can be measured. These variables do not have distinct gaps or interruptions in their possible values. For example, plant height, yield, temperature, and panicle length are continuous variables because they can be measured to a high degree of precision, such as 5.5 cm, 5.8 cm, or any value within a relevant range. Continuous variables can assume an infinite number of possible values within a given range, making them different from discrete variables.\nCategorical Variables\nA categorical variable is a type of variable where the data is divided into distinct categories that do not have a numerical value. For example, marital status (single, married, widowed), employment status (employed, unemployed), or religious affiliation (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, others) are examples of categorical variables. These variables are often referred to as qualitative variables, as they describe qualities or characteristics rather than measurable quantities.\nUnlike quantitative variables, categorical variables cannot be measured or counted in the traditional sense. Instead, they classify data into specific groups or categories.",

    "section": "1.9 Measurement Scales",
    "text": "1.9 Measurement Scales\nVariables can be classified into four distinct levels of measurement, each representing a different way of organizing and interpreting data. These four levels are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\nNominal Scale\nThe nominal scale is the most basic level of measurement and applies to categorical (qualitative) variables. Data measured on the nominal scale consist of categories that are distinct but have no inherent order or ranking. The categories are simply used for labeling or naming objects or groups. For example, gender (male, female), blood group (A, B, AB, O), and marital status (single, married, divorced) are all nominal variables. In the nominal scale, arithmetic operations, such as addition or subtraction, cannot be performed on the data.\nOrdinal Scale\nThe ordinal scale also applies to qualitative data, but with an important distinction: the data on the ordinal scale are ordered. This means that the categories have a specific rank or order, but the differences between the categories are not necessarily uniform or meaningful. For example, the grades given in a class (excellent, good, fair, poor) are ordinal, where “excellent” is ranked higher than “good,” and “good” is ranked higher than “fair,” and so on. However, the difference between “excellent” and “good” is not numerically defined, making the exact magnitude of the difference unclear. Ordinal data allows us to say that one value is greater or lesser than another, but it does not allow for the measurement of exact differences.\nInterval Scale\nThe interval scale is used for quantitative (numerical) data, and it provides more information than the nominal or ordinal scales. On the interval scale, the data points are ordered, and the differences between them are meaningful and measurable. However, the interval scale does not have a true zero point. This means that while we can measure the difference between values, we cannot make statements about ratios between them. An example of an interval scale is temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. For instance, if the temperature in two cities is 20°C and 30°C, we can say that the temperature in the second city is 10°C higher. However, we cannot say that the second city is “twice as hot” as the first city, because the zero point (0°C) does not represent the absence of temperature.\nRatio Scale\nThe ratio scale is the highest level of measurement and applies to quantitative data. It shares the properties of the interval scale—ordered data with measurable differences between values—but it also has a meaningful zero point. This true zero point represents the total absence of the quantity being measured. With the ratio scale, not only can we measure differences between values, but we can also compute meaningful ratios. For example, weight is measured on the ratio scale. A weight of 60 kg is twice as much as a weight of 30 kg, and a weight of 0 kg indicates the complete absence of weight. Similarly, temperature measured on the Kelvin scale is an example of a ratio scale, where 0 Kelvin represents absolute zero, the complete absence of heat.\nIn summary, the key distinctions between these measurement scales are:\n\nNominal: Categories without any order.\nOrdinal: Ordered categories without consistent differences.\nInterval: Ordered data with meaningful differences, but no true zero.\nRatio: Ordered data with meaningful differences and a true zero point, allowing for meaningful ratios.\n\n\n\n\nClassification of variables",

    "text": "1.10 Collection of Data\nThe process of collecting data is the foundational step in any statistical investigation or research study. Data can be gathered for an entire population or for a sample drawn from it. Typically, data collection is performed on a sample basis, especially when studying large populations. Collecting data is a challenging task, requiring skill and precision. The person responsible for gathering the data, known as the enumerator or investigator, must be well-trained to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected. The individuals or groups providing the information are referred to as the respondents.\n\n1.10.1 Types of Data\nData collection can be categorized into two main types based on the source from which the data is derived:\n\nPrimary Data\nSecondary Data\n\nPrimary Data\nPrimary data refer to first-hand, original data that are collected directly by the researcher or an organization for a specific purpose. These data have not been processed or analyzed previously and are considered the most authentic form of data. Primary data are typically gathered through surveys, interviews, experiments, or observations, and they represent a direct reflection of the phenomena being studied.\nExample: Population census data collected by the government are considered primary data. These are collected directly from individuals by government authorities for the purpose of census enumeration and demographic analysis.\nSecondary Data\nSecondary data refer to data that have already been collected, processed, and published by other organizations or researchers for a different purpose. These data may have undergone some degree of analysis or treatment before being made available for new studies. Secondary data are often more convenient to use, as they are readily accessible, but they may not always perfectly suit the specific needs of the researcher.\nExample: An economic survey of a country, such as reports from the Bureau of Statistics or other governmental agencies, is an example of secondary data. These data were originally collected for purposes such as policy analysis or economic planning, and now can be used for additional research.\nThe distinction between primary and secondary data lies primarily in their origin and the process of collection. Primary data are first-hand, original data collected directly from a single source by the researcher for a specific purpose. These data are considered pure as they have not undergone any prior statistical treatment. In contrast, secondary data are obtained from existing sources or agencies and have been previously collected and processed for different purposes. They are not considered pure as they have undergone some form of statistical treatment. While primary data are original and collected for the first time, secondary data are pre-existing and gathered from other sources. Both types of data have their respective advantages and limitations, and the choice between them depends on the research objectives, availability of resources, and the nature of the study.",

This information cannot easily be obtained from the raw data.\nIt should be noted that, even though above table is concise, some information is lost. For example, the grouped frequency distribution does not give us the exact plant height of the paddy varieties. Thus the individual plant height of the paddy varieties are lost in our effort to obtain an overall picture.\n\n1.14.1 Terms used\nClass limits\nThe intervals into which the observations are put are called class intervals. The end points of the class intervals are called class limits. For example, the class interval 100 – 109, has lower class limit 100 and upper class limit 109.\nClass boundaries\nThe raw data in the above example were recorded to the nearest centimeters. Thus, a plant height of 109.5cm would have been recorded as 110cm, a plant height of 119.4 cm would have been recorded as 119cm, while a plant height of 119.5 cm would have been recorded as 120 cm. It can therefore be seen that, the class interval 110 – 119, consists of measurements greater than or equal to 109.5 cm and less than 119.5 cm. The numbers 109.5 and 119.5 are called the lower and upper boundaries of the class interval 110 – 120. The class boundaries of the other class intervals are given below:\n\n\n\nlass boundary and class limits\n\n\nNote:\nNotice that the lower class boundary of the ith class interval is the mean of the lower class limit of the class interval and the upper class limit of the (i-1)th class interval (i = 2, 3, 4, …). For example, in the table above the lower class boundaries of the second and the fourth class intervals are (110 + 119) /2 = 114.5 and (130 + 139)/2 = 134.5 respectively.\nIt can also be seen that the upper class boundary of the ith class interval is the mean of the upper class limit of the class interval and the lower class limit of the (i+1)th class interval (i = 1, 2, 3, …). Thus, in the above table the upper class boundary of the fourth class interval is (130 + 139)/2 = 134.5.\nClass mark\nThe mid-point of a class interval is called the class mark or class mid-point of the class interval. It is the average of the upper and lower class limits of the class interval. It is also the average of the upper and lower class boundaries of the class interval. For example, in the table, the class mark of the third class interval was found as follows: class mark =(120+129)/2 = (119.5 + 129.5)/2= 124.5.\nClass width\nThe difference between the upper and lower class boundaries of a class interval is called the class width of the class interval. Class widths of class intervals can also be found by subtracting two consecutive lower class limits, or by subtracting two consecutive upper class limits.\nNote:\nThe width of the ith class interval is the numerical difference between the upper class limits of the ith and the ( i-1)th class intervals (i = 2, 3, …). It is also the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the ith and the (i+1)th class intervals (i = 1, 2, …).\nIn grouped frequency table above the width of the second class interval is |110-119| = 9. This is the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the second and the third class intervals. The width of the third class interval is |120-129|= 9. This is the numerical difference between the lower class limits of the third and the fourth class intervals.\n\n\n1.14.2 Construction\nStep 1. Decide how many classes you wish to use.\nStep 2. Determine the class width\nStep 3. Set up the individual class limits\nStep 4. Tally the items into the classes\nStep 5. Count the number of items in each class\nConsider the example\nAn agricultural student measured the lengths of leaves on an oak tree (to the nearest cm). Measurements on 38 leaves are as follows\n9,16,13,7,8,4,18,10,17,18,9,\n12,5,9,9,16,1,8,17,1,10,5,9,11,\n15,6,14,9,1,12,5,16,4,16,8,15,14,17\nStep 1. Decide how many classes you wish to use.\nH.A. Sturges provides a formula for determining the approximation number of classes. \\[\\mathbf{k = 1 + 3.322}.\\mathbf{\\log}\\mathbf{N}\\] Number of classes should be greater than calculated k\nIn our example N=38, so k= (1+3.322)×log(38) = (1+3.322)×1.5797 = 6.24 = approx 7\nSo the approximated number of classes should be not less than 6.24 i.e.\\(\\ k^{'}\\) =7\nStep 2. Determine the class width\nGenerally, the class width should be the same size for all classes. C= | max − min|/ k. Class width \\(C^{'}\\)should be greater than calculated C. For this example, C = | 18− 1|/6.24 = 2.72, so approximately class width \\(C^{'} =\\) 3 (Note that k used here is the calculated value using Sturges formula not the approximated).\nStep 3. To set up the individual class limits, we need to find the lower limit only\n\\[L = min - \\frac{C^{'} \\times k^{'} - (max - min)}{2}\\]\nwhere C and k here are final approximated class width and number of classes respectively in our example \\(L = 1 - \\frac{(3 \\times 7) - (18 - 1)}{2}\\)=1-2=-1; since there is no negative values in data = 0.\n\n\n\nClass\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n0-3\n3\n\n\n3-6\n5\n\n\n6-9\n5\n\n\n9-12\n9\n\n\n12-15\n5\n\n\n15-18\n9\n\n\n18-21\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the student only measured in whole numbers, the data is continuous, so “4 cm” means the actual value could have been anywhere from 3.5 cm to 4.5 cm.",

    "text": "1.15 Cumulative frequency\nIn many situations, we are not interested in the number of observations in a given class interval, but in the number of observations which are less than (or greater than) a specified value. For example, in the above table, it can be seen that 3 leaves have length less than 3.5 cm and 9 leaves (i.e. 3 + 6) have length less than 6.5 cm. These frequencies are called cumulative frequencies. A table of such cumulative frequencies is called a cumulative frequency table or cumulative frequency distribution.\nCumulative frequency is defined as a running total of frequencies. Cumulative frequency can also defined as the sum of all previous frequencies up to the current point. Notice that the last cumulative frequency is equal to the sum of all the frequencies. Two types of cumulative frequencies are Less than cumulative frequency and Greater than cumulative frequency. Less than cumulative frequency (LCF) is the number of values less than a specified value. Greater than cumulative frequency (GCF) is the number of observations greater than a specified value.\nThe specified value for LCF in the case of grouped frequency distribution will be upper limits and for GCF will be the lower limits of the classes. LCF’s are obtained by adding frequencies in the successive classes and GCF are obtained by subtracting the successive class frequencies from the total frequency.",

It supports decision-making by presenting facts in an organized manner, aids in the formulation of effective policies, facilitates comparisons, and assists in making forecasts. By applying appropriate statistical methods, researchers can draw valid conclusions from experiments.\nApplications of Statistics: Statistics has become an integral part of almost every field of human activity. It is indispensable in areas such as administration, business, economics, research, banking, insurance, and more. Its ability to quantify and analyze data makes it an essential tool across industries.\nCommon Limitations of Statistics: - Statistical methods are applicable only when there is variability in the data being studied. - Statistics focuses on the analysis of groups or aggregates, rather than individual data points. - The results derived from statistical analysis are often approximate and subject to uncertainty. - Statistics is sometimes misapplied or misinterpreted, leading to erroneous conclusions.\nAs a statistician, I believe that the power of statistics knows no bounds. It is a tool that, when applied correctly, can unlock insights from any dataset. While the limitations listed above are commonly found in textbooks and curricula across SAUs (State Agricultural Universities), I believe these are more about guiding students on the appropriate use of statistics rather than presenting true constraints. With the right methodology and approach, statistics can be applied in any situation to derive valuable insights and support sound decision-making.",

These investigators engage with individuals, asking questions and filling out questionnaires based on the responses. This method is widely used by organizations for larger data collection efforts.\nCollection through Questionnaire\nResearchers distribute questionnaires to local representatives or agents who collect data based on their own experience and observations. While this method is relatively quick, it typically provides only a rough estimate of the information.\nThrough the Telephone\nData is gathered by contacting individuals via telephone. This method is fast and allows for accurate information to be collected efficiently, making it suitable for studies that require a broad reach but still need reliable data.",

The General Crop Estimation Survey (GCES) covers 65 crops, including 51 food crops and 14 non-food crops. Approximately 9 lakh CCEs are carried out annually in India to estimate the yield of key crops such as rice, maize, bajra, groundnut, and sugarcane. These experiments are conducted systematically to ensure accurate and reliable yield data for principal crops.\n\n\n\nSampling Design under General Crop Estimation Survey\n\n\nFinal estimates of crop production are calculated using area figures obtained through complete enumeration and yield rates derived from crop-cutting experiments. These estimates become available only after the harvest. However, to support timely decision-making, the Government requires advance production estimates.\nThe Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES), under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, provides advance estimates of crop area and production for key food and non-food crops such as food grains, oilseeds, sugarcane, and fibres. These estimates are issued in four stages:\n\nFirst forecast: Mid-September\n\nSecond forecast: January\n\nThird forecast: Late March\n\nFourth forecast: Late May\n\nIn addition to these forecasts, Final Estimates of crop area and production are published in December. Subsequently, Fully Revised Estimates for all-India crop statistics are released in December of the following crop year.\nAdditionally, information on the structure and characteristics of the agricultural sector is gathered through the Agricultural Census.",

It provides essential information about operational holdings, including their number, area, land use, cropping patterns, and input usage, down to the lowest geographical levels such as villages, tehsils (sub-districts), and districts. This census serves as a statistical framework for planning and conducting future agricultural surveys.\nInitiated in 1970-71, the Agricultural Census is conducted every five years by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in collaboration with State and Union Territory administrations. In States with land records, the number and area of operational holdings are collected through complete enumeration, while detailed data on the characteristics of operational holdings are gathered on a sample basis.\nTo date, eleven Agricultural Censuses have been conducted, covering the reference years 1970-71, 1976-77, 1980-81, 1985-86, 1990-91, 1995-96, 2000-01, 2005-06, 2010-11, 2015-16, and 2020-21. The reference period for each census corresponds to the agricultural year, spanning from July to June.\nThe data derived from the Agricultural Census plays a crucial role in policy formulation, resource allocation, and the overall development of the agricultural sector in India.\nAdditional data pertaining to various sectors can be obtained from the sources listed in the (appendix-1?)",
